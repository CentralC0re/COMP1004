# SPA Password Manager
A single page, web based password manager running locally.

This program has the following features:
- Sign-In with cryptography
- Credential creation
- Credential modification
- Password copying
- Save and Load functionality

Though the Save and Load functionality was intended to use cryptography, there was insufficient time to properly implement it.
See the "Experimental" branch for the attempted implementation, note that this version is not functional.
